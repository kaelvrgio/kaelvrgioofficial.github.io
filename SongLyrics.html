<h1>"Golden Hour" by JVKE</h1>
<p>
    It was just two lovers, sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde<br>
    Fallin' for each other, pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish<br>
    No Donald Glover, missed call from my mother<br>
    Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi<br>
</p>
<p>
    I was all alone with the love of my life<br>
    She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night<br>
    I don't need no light to see you<br>
</p>
<p>
    Shine<br>
    It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)<br>
    You slow down time<br>
    In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)<br>
</p>
<p>
    We were just two lovers, feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast<br>
    Burnin' through the summer, radio on blast, make the moment last<br>
    She got solar power, minutes feel like hours<br>
    She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine<br>
</p>
<p>
    Fallin' like I did for the love of my life?<br>
    She's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes<br>
    My angel of light<br>
</p>
<p>
    I was all alone with the love of my life<br>
    She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night<br>
    I don't need no light to see you<br>
</p>
<p>
    Shine<br>
    It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)<br>
    You slow down time<br>
    In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)<br>
</p>
